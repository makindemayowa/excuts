              The vast majority of people using dating sites are sincere and honest in the information they provide
                and in their reasons for joining.
              <br />
              However, there are exceptions, and you need to be aware of how to keep yourself and your bank account and savings
              protected while meeting people online.

              Never Send Money or Financial Information
            </h6>
            <p className="content">
              Never respond to any request to send money,
              especially overseas or via wire transfer,
              and report it to us immediately.
              Even if the person claims to be in an emergency.
              Wiring money is like sending cash:
              the sender has no protections against loss and it’s nearly impossible to reverse the transaction or trace the money.

              Trust Your Instincts.
            </h6>
            <p className="content">
              Sometimes you just know when something is not right!
              It is always important to use common sense, as your instinct is a powerful
              tool when dating and great way to measure when to build a relationship or
              turn and run. As you begin to read personal profiles,
              respond to emails or speak on the phone your instincts will help tell
              you if something is right or not. If you are in any doubt, be careful,
              back off, or proceed carefully!

              Request a Recent Photo
            </h6>
            <p className="content">
              If your contact does not have a photo on their profile request a recent one.
              It's important for you to get a good look at the person you may eventually meet.
              Plus your instincts from your communications and their photos may provide you with
              valuable insight into the person. If a person lies about their photo or profile then that
              is a red flag to no longer pursue the date.

              When You First Meet Ensure You Visit a Public Place
            </h6>
            <p className="content">
              When it's time to meet up arrange to meet in a public place 
              and provide your own transportation. Never accept an offer to be picked up from your house 
              on the first date. Make sure you tell someone ie a friend, where you are going. Your first meeting 
              will tell you a great deal about the other person. 
              Be thinking about what questions to ask your date on route!

              Consumption of alcohol and/or other drugs can impair your judgment and potentially put you in danger. 
              It’s important to keep a clear mind and avoid anything that might place you at risk. 
              Be aware that bad actors might try to take advantage of you by altering your beverage(s) with synthetic substances.
